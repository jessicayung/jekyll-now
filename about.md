### About me

I am an Economics undergraduate at the University of Cambridge with a strong interest in machine learning. I recently completed Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree [link to project code](https://github.com/jessicayung/machine-learning-nd/) and am a NVIDIA Scholar for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree starting October 2016. 

I have experience with UX design, managing agile web dev teams and building web applications. I built [HelloMotions.com](http://hellomotions.com), a debating motions database used by debaters in over 50 countries.

### About this site

Welcome to my programming journal! 

#### Purpose and Audience
I decided to set this up alongside my [main blog](http://www.jessicayung.com) because I wanted to post shorter snippets focused on analysing code and programming problems.

This journal is for anyone who is learning to code and wants to find out what one person's thought process might be like. I am also writing this for future reference because I don't have fantastic long-term memory. :)

#### Specific examples of content
I will write about:
- My process when it comes to tackling programming problems (initial approaches and how they morph into more efficient solutions)
- Particularly tricky parts of programming problems
- Improvements to code
- Elegant code that I like

Problems will mostly be taken from:
- [InterviewCake](http://interviewcake.com/) Problems (44 problems)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850) (189 problems)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
